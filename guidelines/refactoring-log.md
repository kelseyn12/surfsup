# Code Refactoring Log

This document records all refactoring efforts, including changes made and the rationale behind them.

- [WebSocket Implementation and Testing](#websocket-implementation-and-testing)

## Initial Setup

### Date: April 5, 2023

#### Changes Made:
- Created project directory structure with appropriate folders for components, screens, utils, etc.
- Set up TypeScript interfaces for all data models in the application
- Created utility files with helper functions for data formatting and calculations
- Added constants for application-wide configuration

#### Rationale:
- Organized directory structure follows React Native best practices for maintainability
- TypeScript interfaces provide type safety and clear data modeling
- Utility functions ensure consistent formatting and calculations throughout the app
- Constants provide a single source of truth for configuration values

#### Benefits:
- Improved code organization and discoverability
- Enhanced type safety with TypeScript
- Reduced duplication through shared utility functions
- Easier maintenance with centralized constants

## WebSocket Implementation and Testing

### Date: [Current Date]

#### Changes Made
- Implemented mock WebSocket service in `src/services/websocket.ts`
- Integrated WebSocket with global state management
- Added real-time surfer count updates
- Implemented check-in status notifications
- Added connection status handling

#### Testing Results
- Successfully tested WebSocket connection establishment
- Verified real-time surfer count updates
- Confirmed check-in status synchronization
- Validated connection status notifications
- Tested across multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Web)

#### Technical Details
- Used mock implementation for development
- Implemented TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Added error handling and reconnection logic
- Integrated with existing state management
- Documented in code with clear comments

#### Next Steps
- Consider implementing real WebSocket server for production
- Add more comprehensive error handling
- Implement reconnection strategies
- Add WebSocket connection status indicators in UI

## Future Refactoring Plans

### Component Structure
- [ ] Extract reusable UI elements from screen components
- [ ] Create a component library for common UI patterns
- [ ] Implement theming support for light/dark mode

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Memoize expensive calculations
- [ ] Implement virtualized lists for large data sets
- [ ] Add lazy loading for screens

### State Management
- [ ] Evaluate state management needs (Context API vs Redux)
- [ ] Set up proper state structure for application data
- [ ] Implement optimistic updates for better UX

### API and Data Fetching
- [ ] Create service layer for API interactions
- [ ] Implement proper caching strategies
- [ ] Add retry and error handling mechanisms
